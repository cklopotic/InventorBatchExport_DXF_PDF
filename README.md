# InventorBatchExport_DXF_PDF
This is a simple little macro written in VBA that you can add into your AutoDesk Inventor software to allow you to batch export your drawings as PDF's and DXF's.
It is very crude, not much for error checking, poor style, constants, etc. Very well needs some attention to make more user friendly and easy to use.  Much of the code was snippets from examples in AutoDesk's help files, slightly modified to suit my needs.

That being said, I had a fairly large project with many drawings that we sent out for fabrication.  I later was asked for the drawings to be in both PDF and DXF format.  I didn't feel like opening all of those files up and sitting forver clicking around on SaveCopyAs commands for a few hours.  After a quick web search I couldn't find anything that was a quick and easy solution.  So I whipped up this script to do it for me becuase writing this was more enjoyable than clicking around for a few hours.  Plus I'll be able to use this again in the future.

You are more than welcome to modify and use.  Hopefully it will save you time like it did for me.
